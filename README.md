## POKEDEX

This app lets you search through the 1020 pokemon out there and select them. They'll be saved into your history and you can pull them up from there any time.

Please clone this repo.

In your terminal, navigate to the `pokedex` folder.

Run `npm install`
Once installed run `npm start`

This should open a browser at 'localhost:3000'

Type in search and you'll see the pokemon appear. Click on a name to select one.

Have fun!

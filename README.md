## POKEDEX

This app lets you search through the 1020 pokemon out there and select them. They'll be saved into your history and you can pull them up from there any time.

Please clone this repo.

In your terminal, navigate to the `pokedex` folder.

Run `npm install`
Once installed run `npm start`

This should open a browser at 'localhost:3000'

Type in search and you'll see the pokemon appear. Click on a name to select one.

Have fun!

### Todo:

One thing I didn't get to was enabling a return feature on the search bar. That would make keyboard input more responsive. It might also be cool to use the cursor to navigate the list of the filtered pokemon.

_Features To Add_

- Abilities, Species, Sprites and Types
- Animations, allow pokemon to slide into view or use their sprites to make an animated loop
- CSS. The layout here is purely functional, mobile considerations didn't make it in. Would be great to make it look like a 1999 pokedex.
- Battles may even be possible. Introducing a basic rank system and a random number generator you could pit two pokemon against each other.

It's a fun api and there is a lot that can be done with it.

Thank you for the coding opportunity. Hope you enjoy.
